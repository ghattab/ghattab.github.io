_"If you have a universe that was just the mirror image of the one we know about, then in fact, presumably it would have right-handed amino acids. That's why I'm only half kidding when I say there is a guy on the other side of the universe with his heart on the right hand side."_―Ronald Breslow

Amino acids occur naturally in plant and animal tissues and are the basic constituents of proteins.
Each amino acid is a simple organic compound containing both a carboxyl (—COOH) and an amino (—NH2) group.
Yet particular features distinguish each molecule.
To learn the amino acids properties and molecular structure of amino acids, I developed an intuitive system to code these features into shapes, colors, and textures.
The result is a pedagogical Quartet-like card game that employs the potential of infographics, graphic design, and game motivation.
