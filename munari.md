_"In life you have to avoid three geometric figures - vicious circles, love triangles and square minds."_―Mario Benedetti

<br/>
<br/>
In the early 1960s Italian designer Bruno Munari published his visual case studies on shapes: Circle, Square, and, a decade later, Triangle. From the ring, to the _quadra_, to the three angles shape, intricate patterns can be created. To rediscover them in a more organic manner, I’ve employed a [Context-Free grammar](/grammar) to generate the following drawings.

![Circle](/images/circle.png){: .center-image }
<br/>
![Square](/images/square.png){: .center-image }
<br/>
![Triangle](/images/triangle.png){: .center-image }
