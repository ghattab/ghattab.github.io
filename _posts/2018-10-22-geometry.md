How can we imagine something that we’ve never seen? Something that may be at the edge of the world?
Geometry explains a large majority of the world around us. It not only describes what we can sense but also what we may imagine.
As its own branch of mathematics, it is concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space.


## History

While basic geometric shapes (e.g. square, circle) are found in a number of early cultures (e.g. Mayan and Mesoamerican cultures), such shapes were first considered since they can be created by combining specific amounts of lines and/or curves.

The consideration of more complex 3D shapes seem to have permitted mathematics and more broadly Science to be what it is today. 
An important example dates back from ca. 2000 BC in Prehistoric Scotland, where carved [stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carved_stone_balls) balls exhibit a variety of symmetries including all of the symmetries of [Platonic solids](https://ghattab.github.io/geometry/#platonic).
Another noteworthy evidence is from 1800 BC, in Ancient Egypt, the Moscow mathematical [papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Mathematical_Papyrus). It shows that calculating areas and volumes of various geometric shapes was already feasible (e.g. cylinder, pyramid).

Moreover, geometry inspired many designers across different cultures. In the particular example of the circle shape, this spans from compositions obtained from circles, disks, and parts of them in the Key of Solomon (ca. 1350), to l’[itoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27itoi) or the man in the maze from Native American culture, to Marcel Duchamp's optical disks or rotoreliefs (1936).
In the early 1960s, a visual case study on these basic shapes was published by Bruno Munari (1).


## Definitions

Mathematically, these basic shapes are referred to as polygons. 
A polygon is a plane figure with at least three straight sides and angles.
A regular polygon is a many sided polygon in which the sides are all the same length and are symmetrically placed about a common center, i.e. the polygon is both equiangular and equilateral (2).

Using these polygons, we can define a polyhedron as a solid figure with many plane surfaces (faces) and intersections (vertices). 

* A convex polyhedron can be defined as a polyhedron for which a line connecting any two (non-coplanar) points on the surface always lies in the interior of the polyhedron.
* A regular polyhedron can be defined as a polyhedron for which every face is the same regular polygon, and for which every vertex is regular.

The 92 convex polyhedra having only regular polygons as faces are called the Johnson solids, which include the Platonic solids and Archimedean solids.

<div style="display: inline-block;">
Each polyhedron is displayed as a polyhedral graph, or the undirected graph formed from the vertices and edges of a convex polyhedron (3).
</div>

## Platonic solids

In the particular case of 3D shapes where each face is the same regular polygon and the same number of polygons meet at each vertex or corner, the polyhedra are highly symmetrical.
This means their appearance is unchanged by reflection, or rotation of space.
These special polyhedra are both regular and convex. They are named after Plato: Platonic solids.
As indicated by the longest mathematical proof to date on 'the classification of finite simple groups', there are only five Platonic solids: tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron (4).
For example, a hexahedron or a cube, consists of six same-sized square faces, and each three squares meet at each vertex.

Polyhedral graphs corresponding to the skeleton of Platonic solids. The five platonic graphs are represented from left to right:  tetrahedral, cubical, octahedral, dodecahedral, and icosahedral. 


## Archimedean solids

The faces of Archimedes polyhedra are regular polygons of two or three types.
Their vertices are superimposable, irregular, and lay on a circumscribed sphere.
Their edges have the same length.

Now imagine if we were to cluster a series of spheres of the same size like a cluster of graphs. To do so, we subject them to equal and steady pressure by submerging them in water, little pressure areas would build up between the spheres. 
If such a pressure is permitted to build up, the spheres will eventually collapse into their more stable shape: a cluster of tetradecahedra.

## Tetradecahedron

A tetradecahedron is one of the 13 polyhedra of Archimedes. 
It was discussed in the 17th century by Kepler.
and it's sometimes called the 'cuboctohedron' (Thomson, 1887). 

It has exactly 13 vertices: a central one, plus the outer ones that define 12 directions in space.
As shown below, there are 12 elements in the neighborhood of the central element arranged in four interleaved hexagons.
It is also a semi-regular polyhedron since its 14 sides or faces are different polygons.

It is the only solid in which the length of the vertices is equal to that of the radial distance from the solid's center of gravity to any vertex.
This implies that the line drawn from the center of this polyhedron is the same length no matter the direction.
Upon examination, the tetradecahedron is rounder than a cube but squarer than a sphere.

When the tetradecahedron's vertices are represented as equidistant spheres and this representation is projected onto two-dimensions, we obtain the [Metatron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron) cube.
The latter figures in Kabbalist scriptures and Christian art.
  
The repetition of certain shapes creates intricate patterns. Some of these repetitive patterns are historic ornamental art and have been reported across different cultures.

Today, we could use a set of rules to computationally create such patterns (e.g. using a cellular automaton: the [Garden of Eden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden_(cellular_automaton))).

## Cellular automata

A cellular automaton is a collection of ‘colored’ cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells. The rules are then applied iteratively for a given number of steps (5).

There exists various biological applications. A noteworthy one is reproducing the wave patterns on the skin of cephalopods which corresponds to the activity of chromatophores. This can be simulated with a two-state, 2D cellular automata, in which each state corresponds to either an expanded or retracted chromatophore (6).

Systems like cellular automata can readily be set up on any geometrical structure in which a limited number of types of cells can be identified, with every cell of a given type having a similar neighborhood.
In a simple case, the cells of a system are all identical, and are laid out in the same orientation in a repetitive array. This means that all cell centers form a lattice (7).

When considering the hexagonal kernel of Smith (1969) and extending it into three dimensions, the result is the tetradecahedron. 
This extension is a logical transform.
In this case, it also corresponds to a hexahedral tessellation (i.e. an arrangement of polygons in a repeated pattern without gaps or overlapping).
Such an extension of a two-dimensional logical transform to spaces of higher dimensionality provides a practical usage (e.g. image processing). 


## Image processing and analysis 

Although image processing and analysis is often seen as operations on 2D arrays of values or images, there is however a number of fields where images of higher dimensionality must be analyzed. 
The analysis of image data from biological tissue, in both Biology and Medicine, requires such operations.
Common operations are correlations, convolutions, and filter functions. Computationally, multidimensional filters are implemented as a sequence of one-dimensional filters.

## Cell packing

In structural design, appropriate models are required for designing structural components consisting or in total of solid foam. An early probabilistic model accounting for the uncertainty in the cell wall orientation of two-dimensional cellular structures has been provided by the literature (8).

![](/images/packing.gif){: .center-image }

The most important foam model is Kelvin’s tetradecahedron, which has been derived from the idea to construct a spatially repeating regular cell-packing model with a minimum surface-to-volume ratio. 
This polyhedron is also used in the design of porous metal foams. In the context of effective thermal conductivity, a highly porous aluminum foam has been evaluated (Yang 2014).
This porous cellular aluminum structure consists of inner-connected pores and fiber-made skeleton.  
Due to the connectedness of its inner pores, the foam can be saturated by a fluid (e.g. air, water) (9).

Although the space-filling shape of a tetradecahedron is used in the design of polyester sponge foams to maintain minimal surface energy (Thomson 1887, Weaire and Hutzler 1999) and a minimum total face area (Kelvin 1887), other research suggests that other designs can be more efficient.
In 1993 Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan discovered a layered repetitive arrangement of 12- and 14-faced polyhedra that yields 0.003 times less total area.   
Moreover, it is possible that there are other polyhedra which fill space in a less regular fashion and yield still a smaller total area.
In the special case of maintaining minimal surface area, the polyhedra are slightly curved.


## Biology

Circa 1923, Lewis has shown that cells of the elder pith, cells of the human adipose tissue, and cells of the epithelium have on an average fourteen faces, and therefore are or tend to be tetradecahedra (10). In 1979, it was described for the inner-wall cells of a sunflower (11).

To maintain epithelial order, epithelial cells must be continuously renewed. In the case of mammalian epidermis, newly formed basal junctions of epithelial cells are tricellular junctions or TJ among different cells.
Using _in vivo_ 3D imaging, researchers observed that they do follow the cell-packing model, in which the epidermal cells have a flattened tetradecahedron shape (12, 13).

## Discussion

If you’ve read this far and you’re not convinced of the tetradecahedron’s power, let’s turn to design and Space (with a big s).
Technologically speaking, aeronautics could use the geometrical properties of the tetradecahedron.  
Now imagine it is the shape of a space module (i.e. a standardized part or independent unit), we can construct a more complex structure.
Provided the functionality of such modules is solved for living quarters, clustering them and shaping cities on other planets is a logical step.

It happens that some crystals use a tetradecahedron as a space division technique: Magnetite (Fe3O4), Magnesium silicide (Mg2Si), and other crystalline selenides: Ta2P, NiTa8Se8.
In the context of crystal growth, these tetradecahedra based models are reproducible and help in modeling new materials (14, 15, 16). Yet they do not account for the geometric uncertainty of the microstructure. To circumvent this problem, a Voronoï process generates cell structures representative of the microstructure (17).

In the previous sunflower example, it is also commonly known that the flowers show a Fibonacci sequence.
In 2016, a study by Swinton et al showed that it’s not as simple as everyone thought. Results indicated that nearly one in five of the flowers had either non-Fibonacci spiraling patterns or patterns more complicated than has previously been reported.

Since humans are pattern seeking species, geometry helps us at shedding light over curious occurrences.
Some forms are too hypnotizing and are considered sacred (e.g. the [flower of life](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FlowerofLife.html) - top left fig. below).  
Ultimately, geometry answers some interesting questions.
