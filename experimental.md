There is something ungrateful and startling about taking advantage of our abundance of information without caring to understand how it got there. Experimentation in itself leads to information. Naturally, there is a sense of satisiveness in the discovery of knowledge, yet experimentation is valuable in its own right. Experimentation is a tool that continuously strips layers and opens up possibilities for a redefinition of reality.
