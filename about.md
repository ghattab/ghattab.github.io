Currently, I am the group leader of the Visualization unit at the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Public Health Research (ZKI-PH), [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN/). 
<br/>
<br/>
Previously, I was a junior group leader of the Analytics and Visualization group and headed the Bioinformatics division with the mentorship of [Prof. Dominik Heider](http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146) at [Philipps-Universität Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en), Germany.
Prior to that, I was in the field of computational medicine, particularly surgical translational research, as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Center for Tumor Diseases, [NCT](https://www.nct-dresden.de/en.html) with [Prof. Stefanie Speidel](http://bit.ly/2SaNnos) (Dresden, Germany) and in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center, [DKFZ](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html).
Before that, I obtained a PhD in natural Sciences (rerum naturalium), in particular Bioinformatics at [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/). I was supervised by [Prof. Tim W. Nattkemper](https://biodatamining.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/people.html#leader) and [Prof. Tamara Munzner](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/).
Prior to that, I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees in bioinformatics at Paris Diderot University, part of [Université de Paris](https://u-paris.fr/en/) (Paris, France).
