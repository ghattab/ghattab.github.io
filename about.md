Currently, I am a junior group leader and I am working on solving long-term information storage problems. I also head the Bioinformatics division with the mentorship of [Prof. Dominik Heider](http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146) at [Philipps-Universität Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en), Germany.
<br/>
<br/>

Previously, I was in the field of computational medicine, particularly translational research, as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Center for Tumor Diseases, [NCT](https://www.nct-dresden.de/en.html) with [Prof. Stefanie Speidel](http://bit.ly/2SaNnos) (Dresden, Germany) and in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center, [DKFZ](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html).
Before that, I obtained a PhD in natural Sciences (rerum naturalium), in particular Bioinformatics at [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/). I was supervised by [Prof. Tim W. Nattkemper](https://biodatamining.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/people.html#leader) and [Prof. Tamara Munzner](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/).
Prior to that, I obtained both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Bioinformatics from Paris Diderot University, part of Université Paris Sorbonne [USPC](https://u-paris.fr/en/) (Paris, France).
