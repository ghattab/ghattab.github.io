From the ancient Egyptians' fixed rules of a canon, a measurement that is based on the square to the proportions of the gothic style, to the numerous examples of circles as halos depicted around Catholic saints and the Muslim Talisman, to triangles in the star of David, to the Shinto principles of 'Sanmi-sangen', these shapes cross religious and spiritual lines. Understanding both ancient and modern art relies on comprehending the three most simple and frequently used shapes: the square, the circle, and the triangle.

From the ring, to the _quadra_, to the three angles shape, intricate patterns can be created. Below, I rediscover them in a more organic manner using a [context-free grammar](/grammar).
