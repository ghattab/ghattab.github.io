## Augmented Reality
The use of Augmented Reality (AR) for the visualization of 3D biomedical image data is possible thanks to a growing number of hardware and software solutions. 
Considerable efforts are made during surgery, where the visual information of the target structures can either be highlighted or dulled. 
However, as technical challenges and barriers to development decrease, it's increasingly important to take into account the specific capacities and constraints of the surgeon's perceptual and cognitive systems. 
To address this legitimate problem, I present a practical framework that evaluates the importance of visual encodings and renderings for surgical AR. 
By conducting a task-specific user study using this framework, I observed a set of emerging visualization strategies.

The given task was to make the kidney boundary visually salient and make the tumor and calyx distinguishable. 
After having recruited 23 participants from both the medical and the translational srugical fields, I found two preferred presets to tackle this task. 
With both presets, the usage of color, depth, and opacity improved the display of the organ bounds while contrasting the tumor and calyx. 
19 participants successfully completed the task using the modular and evaluative framework. 
Their preference was to either find a good preset where the organ bounds were visible then adjust the color of target objects or vice versa. 
In addition to allowing the identification of the effective visualization that best fits the task requirements, the modularity of the framework allows for the exchange of the target model for augmentation. 
The results allowed for rapid evaluation prior to deployment of a surgical AR solution.

## Virtual Reality
Recent technological advances have made Virtual Reality (VR) attractive in both research and real world applications such as training, rehabilitation, and gaming.
Although these other fields benefited from VR technology, it remains unclear whether VR contributes to better spatial understanding and training in the context of surgical planning. In this study, I evaluated the use of VR by comparing the recall of spatial information in two learning conditions: a head-mounted display and a desktop screen. Specifically, I explored a) a scene understanding, and then b) a direction estimation task using two 3D models (i.e., a liver and a pyramid). 
In the scene understanding task, participants had to navigate the rendered the 3D models by means of rotation, zoom and transparency in order to substantially identify the spatial relationships among its internal objects. 
In the subsequent direction estimation task, participants had to point at a previously identified target object, i.e., internal sphere, on a materialized 3D-printed version of the model using a tracked pointing tool.

Results showed that the learning condition did not influence participants’ memory and confidence ratings of the models. 
In contrast, the model type, that is, whether the model to be recalled was a liver or a pyramid significantly affected participants’ memory about the internal structure of the model. 
Furthermore, localizing the internal position of the target sphere was also unaffected by participants' previous experience of the model.
Overall, results provide novel insights on the use of VR in a surgical planning scenario and have paramount implications in medical learning by shedding light on the mental model we make to recall spatial structures.
