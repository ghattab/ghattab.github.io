A photograph is a digital or physical record of an unchanging moment. **The appeal is in the coupling of temporal permanence and spatial reality.** My desire is to bring forth a *sui generis* record of what I see, beyond the conflict of information.

_"Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of a quite intense feeling, a sort of conflict, one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present."_--Ren√© Magritte
