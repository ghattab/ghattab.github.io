The Bacterial Cell Colony Imaging Data 2015 provides a comprehensive dataset of time-lapse images of bacterial cell colonies, focusing on the symbiotic bacterium *Sinorhizobium meliloti*. This dataset is crucial for researchers studying cellular heterogeneity and the individuality of bacterial cells over time.

### Data Set Characteristics

| Characteristic               | Details                    |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Type**                     | Image Files (Phase Contrast, Red, Green, Blue) |
| **Number of Images**         | 2 movies with 460 images each, 4 channels per time point |
| **Image Interval**           | 30 minutes                 |
| **Imaging Technique**        | Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy |
| **Attribute Characteristics**| High-resolution time-lapse imaging |
| **Date Published**           | 2015                       |
| **Associated Tasks**         | Single-cell analysis, cellular heterogeneity studies |

### Data Sets

The dataset consists of two movies, each containing 115 images taken at 30-minute intervals. Each set of images includes four types: phase contrast, red, green, and blue, acquired using two laser sources and TIRF microscopy.

## Overview of Imaging Setup and Data

- **Bacterial Strain**: *Sinorhizobium meliloti*
- **Constructs**: Triple fluorescence reporter cassette
- **Growth Environment**: Microfluidic bacterial plate
- **Imaging Technique**: Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy using two laser sources

## Significance and Applications

Individual cells in a single bacterial population may differ strikingly and even drive the health and function of the entire cell population. To study this phenomenon of individuality over time and contribute to a new understanding of cellular heterogeneity, single-cell oriented high-resolution time-lapse imaging is necessary. TIRF microscopy enables the capture of high-resolution images with reduced background fluorescence, enhancing the visibility of individual cells.
