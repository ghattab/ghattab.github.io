Art involves experimental research by posing problems and searching for solutions through experimentation in a process of trial and error. In photography and cinema, physical forms are documented and previously unseen aspects of reality are displayed. The hidden is brought about in shape and form by the science of new media. For example, what is too slow can be seen through stop-motion. **The appeal is in the methods that crystallize the shape.** My desire is to bring forth a *sui generis* record of what I see, beyond the conflict of information.

_"Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of a quite intense feeling, a sort of conflict, one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present."_--Ren√© Magritte
