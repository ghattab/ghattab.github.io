Collage is the greatest innovation.
Seemingly separate things come together.
They sometimes do with surprising intricacy, bringing forth a meaning or none.
If any, this meaning is often only discernible to the careful or knowledgeable viewer.
By putting things together on a 2D plane, we paint the difference between things and the space among them.
Unlike the painting collages Matisse created, the digital age brought us digital images.
Photo collage can be organized and arranged to meet certain criteria.
Some of those may be hue or saturation. 
However, the modern process of photo collage using digital images echoes the traditional process. 
I detail one traditional example below.


## Implementation conditions
Choose images that appeal by their colors or by what they represent. Tear these images into pieces. If you wish to make the separation stand out, brush black India ink around each piece of image. Place the pieces on the surface as desired to make a new image. Try a couple of different arrangements. When happy, glue the pieces together permanently.


## Notions
By relying on rhythm, repetition, and concepts of full versus empty, one creates an aesthetic perception.
Although part of a whole, discovering the arrangements of shapes, colors, relationships of values helps bring forth meaning and/or emotion.

The specificity of how fragments are organized could be used in other contexts. Paper fragments can be torn into other types of paper: wallpaper, gift paper, colored poster paper. Then, the work will then be more focused on rhythm, repetition of colors or patterns.

Further applications also exist in other fields. In mathematics, the work on algorithms that handle shape matching, repetitions, or even spatial organization. In written expression, the arrangement of shapes and colors can be the support of an opening to the imaginary.
