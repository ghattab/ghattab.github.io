Collage is the greatest innovation.
Seemingly separate things come together.
They sometimes do with surprising intricacy, bringing forth a meaning or none.
If any, this meaning is often only discernible to the careful or knowledgeable viewer.
By putting things together on a 2D plane, we paint the difference between things and the space among them.
Unlike the painting collages Matisse created, the digital age brought us digital images.
However, the collage of photo and/or digital images follows the traditional process.  


## Implementation conditions
Choose images that appeal by their colors or by what they represent. Tear these images into pieces. Brush black India ink around each piece of image. Place the pieces of images on the surface as desired to make a new image. After the adult has checked that the instructions have been followed, glue the pieces together permanently.


## Collective
It is better to work on a large format to allow children to compose the picture of their choice (even if it remains very small). During the "ringing" phase with India ink, it is necessary to place the newspapers under the image fragments, to make sure that the children do not cover the entire fragment and to make sure that they do not get the wrong side!


## Plastic notions
Rhythm, repetition, full/empty.


## Cultural contributions
Chaissac, Dubuffet, Matisse, Viallat.


## Didactic content
Disciplinary objectives | Aesthetic perception: discovering in the arrangements of shapes, colors, relationships of values... pleasure and emotion
--- | --- 
Induced specific vocabulary | Organization; rhythm; repetition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Possible uses in other contexts | Paper fragments can be torn into other types of paper: wallpaper, gift paper, colored poster paper. The work will then be more focused on rhythm, repetition of colors or patterns
Possible applications in other fields | In mathematics: work on algorithms with paper fragments. In written expression: the arrangement of shapes and colors can be the support of an opening to the imaginary. The children discover by observing them silhouettes that they describe and are invited to give a name to their production.
