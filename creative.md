### Research Design

## Amino Acids

Amino acids occur naturally in plant and animal tissues and are the basic constituents of proteins. 
Each amino acid is a simple organic compound containing both a carboxyl (—COOH) and an amino (—NH2) group. 
Yet particular features distinguish each molecule.
To learn the amino acids properties and molecular structure of amino acids, I developed an intuitive system to code these features into shapes, colors, and textures.
The result is a Quartet-like card game that employs the potential of infographics, graphic design, and game motivation. This work was presented at the [Info+](http://informationplusconference.com) conference at ECUAD, Vancouver, Canada.
