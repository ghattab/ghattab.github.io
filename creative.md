### Research Design

## Book covers
  
<!--I have been involved in the design of a couple of book covers:-->
<!--* Comparative Genomics: Methods and Protocols. Setubal, Stoye, and Stadler 2017. [![](/images/cover0.jpg){:style="float: right;"}](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-7463-4) -->
<!---->
<!--* Reversality. Hattab, Bahram, Nazar 2015. A collaboration with the UN Refugee Agency ([UNHCR](http://www.unhcr.org/)). [![](/images/cover1.jpg){:style="float: right;"}](https://www.amazon.com/Reversality-Georges-Hattab/dp/1329113063/)-->



## Amino Acids

Amino acids occur naturally in plant and animal tissues and are the basic constituents of proteins. 
Each amino acid is a simple organic compound containing both a carboxyl (—COOH) and an amino (—NH2) group. 
Yet particular features distinguish each molecule.
To learn the amino acids properties and molecular structure of amino acids, I developed an intuitive system to code these features into shapes, colors, and textures.
The result is a Quartet-like card game that employs the potential of infographics, graphic design, and game motivation.
