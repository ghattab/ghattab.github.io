Physics is concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. From mechanics, to light and other radiation, to electricity, to the structure of atoms, physicists have established physical constants. They are believed to be both universal in nature and have constant value in time. They fall into three categories: exact, computed, measured.


To learn fourteen of the most used physical constants in a fun way, I developed a mnemonic system that relies on amusing associations and consistent [visual encodings](https://github.com/ghattab/banana-physics/blob/master/README.md#visual-encodings).


The result is a mnemonic card set that combines Warholian inspired art, graphic design, information design, and data encoding. Print ready files are available under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License.
