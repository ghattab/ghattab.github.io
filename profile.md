Currently, I’m a junior group leader and work to address the problems of long-term information storage using molecular compounds. I’m also heading the Bioinformatics division with the mentorship of [Prof. Dominik Heider](http://heiderlab.de/?page_id=146) at [Phillips-Universität Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en) (Marburg, Germany).

Previously, I was in the field of computational medicine, particularly translational research, as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Center for Tumor Diseases, [NCT](https://www.nct-dresden.de/en.html) (Dresden, Germany).
Before that, I obtained a PhD in natural Sciences (rerum naturalium), in particular Bioinformatics at [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/). I was supervised by [Prof. Tim W. Nattkemper](https://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/biodatamining/index.php/people/group-leader) and [Prof. Tamara Munzner](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/).
Prior to that, I obtained both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Bioinformatics from Paris Diderot University, part of [USPC](http://www.sorbonne-paris-cite.fr/en) (Paris, France).
