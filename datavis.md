Data visualization or data vis is the act of constructing one or many visual narratives. To tell a story, these narratives may be connected via a certain layout or convention (e.g., reading in Western societies from left to right). Creating a narrative corresponds to visually encoding the data. That is to say, taking the data and mapping it with spatial properties in the pixel or representational space. These properties could be the size or area, length, height, position, angle of an object.
To obtain a meaningful mapping of the data, it is important to know which message should the graphic tell, be mindful of the audience (e.g., color usage), and show the data with the right level of complexity versus simplicity to avoid misleading the reader.
