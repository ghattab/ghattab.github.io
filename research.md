## Biophysics: Membrane proteins

The structural biology of membrane proteins (MP) is hampered by the difficulty in producing and purifying them. I conducted a comprehensive analysis of protein databases and a large scale analysis of expression protocols.
The former revealed that only 213 unique membrane protein structures have been obtained after production of the target protein in *E. coli*. The latter consisted of text mining citing articles of each expression system. As found in the literature, there are three systems: primarily the T7 RNA polymerase, followed by the arabinose, then the T5 promoter based expression systems, respectively. 
The main findings were: (1) the C41λ(DE3) and C43λ(DE3) bacterial mutant hosts have contributed to 28% of non *E. coli* MP structures, (2) there is a preference for a combination of bacterial host-vector together with a bimodal distribution of induction temperature and of inducer concentration. 
Altogether our analyses provide a set of rules for the optimal use of bacterial expression systems in MP production.

Expression systems and bacterial hosts for MP structure determination are reported in the [Tool Box](http://www.ibpc.fr/UMR7099/tool_box/methodological_approaches.html) for MP studies. 
Detailed protocols to select bacterial expression mutant hosts and to optimize culture conditions are provided in a book chapter.
