Research is a systematic investigation into and study of materials to establish facts and reach new conclusions. **The appeal lies in formulating and answering interesting questions.** My desire is to facilitate interdisciplinary research, and teach aspects of the scientific method to reach successive approximations of reality.

_"Scientific work must not be considered from the point of view of the direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself, for the beauty of science, and then there is always the chance that a scientific discovery may become like the radium a benefit for mankind."_--Marie Sk≈Çodowska Curie
