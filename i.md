The transition to new storage technologies is observable at multiple time points. Today, various storage media from different eras are still in use



A major shift of multiple parameters can be clearly observed around Nov. 2011. Important abbreviation: bnp — intracellular nonpolar metabolites, bp — intracellular polar metabolites, ratio — metabolite intracellular/extracellular ratio, snp — extracellular nonpolar metabolites, sp — extracellular polar metabolites.
