_"Inscription devices measure infinitesimal units of time, the fastest and weakest movements, and the smallest variations of forces cannot escape them. They penetrate the intimate function of the organs where life seems to be translated by unceasing mobility.”_—Étiennes-Jules Marey

## Anatomical replicas
Anatomically realistic organs replicas provide more consistent results than the use of a living subject or cadaver. 
In the case of a kidney replica, the related work did neither deal with its design, nor its development using silicone as the only material.
To this end, I have designed a two step experimental pipeline: Uniaxial Compression (UC) testing and Cauchy stress modeling.
The pipeline revealed that none of the available manufacturer silicone brands are suitable for the task of creating a realistic kidney.

The main findings were: 
(1) the silicones advertised as corresponding to the target ranges of elastic properties of a human kidney do not fall within the required target compression moduli,
(2) the data we’ve shared showcases less variability and uncertainty (inc. low (E1) and high (E2) strain moduli), 
(3) the E(max) occurs at a much later stage, and
(4) the maximal reachable stress of the tested silicone mixtures is larger than literature-based reports.
(5) the parameters characterizing the nonlinear elastic model of the silicone mixtures are made available for the purpose of nonlinear finite element simulation of an entire kidney. Altogether these results provide a reference for future work concerned by designing organ replicas.
