Claude Shannon, father of information theory, separated information from meaning. His central dogma, “meaning is irrelevant” explained that information as a mathematical abstraction can be handled independently of meaning. The consequence of this freedom is the flood of information in which we are drowning. The sheer size of modern databases gives us a feeling of insignificance… It is our task as humans to bring meaning back into this wasteland. **As finite creatures who think and feel, we can create islands of meaning in the sea of information.**
