Claude Shannon, father of information theory, separated information from meaning. His central dogma, “meaning is irrelevant” declared that information could be handled as a mathematical abstraction independent of meaning. The consequence of this freedom is the flood of information in which we are drowning. The immense size of modern databases gives us a feeling of meaninglessness… It is our task as humans to bring meaning back into this wasteland. **As finite creatures who think and feel, we can create islands of meaning the sea of information.**
