## Ten simple rules to colorize biological data vis
Methods for visualization of biological data continue to improve, but there is still a fundamental challenge in colorization of these visualizations (vis).  Visual representation of biological data should not overwhelm, obscure, or bias the findings, but rather make them more understandable.  This is often due to the challenge of how to use color effectively in creating visualizations.  The recent global adoption of data vis has helped address this challenge in some fields but it remains open in the biological domain.  The visualization of biological data deals with the application of computer graphics, scientific visualization, and information visualization in various areas of the life sciences.  I described ten simple rules to colorize biological data visualization. The article is used to cover color usage in the biological data visualization seminar at the [Philipps-University Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en).
