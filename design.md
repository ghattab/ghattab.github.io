## Book covers

I have been involved in the design of a couple of book covers:
* [Comparative Genomics: Methods and Protocols](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781493974610). Setubal, Stoye, and Stadler 2017.
<!-- [![](/images/cover0.jpg){:style="float: right;"}](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-7463-4) -->

* [Reversality](https://www.amazon.com/Reversality-Georges-Hattab/dp/1329113063/). Hattab, Bahram, Nazar 2015. A collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

## Banana Physics

Physics is concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. From mechanics, to light and other radiation, to electricity, to the structure of atoms, physicists have established physical constants. They are believed to be both universal in nature and have constant value in time. They fall into three categories: exact, computed, measured.
To learn fourteen of the most used physical constants in a fun way, I developed a mnemonic system that relies on amusing associations and consistent visual encodings.
The result is a mnemonic card set that combines Warholian inspired art, graphic design, information design, and data encoding. Print ready files are available under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 International License.

## Square, Circle, Triangle

In the early 1960s Italian designer Bruno Munari published his visual case studies on shapes: Circle, Square, and, a decade later, Triangle. These studies piqued my interest and I’ve decided to rediscover them in a more organic manner. I’ve employed a Context-Free grammar for each of them to generate the following drawings.

## Amino Acids

Amino acids occur naturally in plant and animal tissues and are the basic constituents of proteins.
Each amino acid is a simple organic compound containing both a carboxyl (—COOH) and an amino (—NH2) group.
Yet particular features distinguish each molecule.
To learn the amino acids properties and molecular structure of amino acids, I developed an intuitive system to code these features into shapes, colors, and textures.
The result is a Quartet-like card game that employs the potential of infographics, graphic design, and game motivation.
